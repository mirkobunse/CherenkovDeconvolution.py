CherenkovDeconvolution
==========

Deconvolution methods for Cherenkov astronomy and other use cases in experimental physics.



Getting Started
---------------

You can install CherenkovDeconvolution.py via `pip` using the provided `Makefile`.
Running `make` without arguments will also run the test cases.

For a quick start, take a look at the Jupyter notebooks in the `examples` directory.
Running `make doc` will generate the API documentation with Sphinx.



Current Status
--------------

CherenkovDeconvolution.py currently implements the Dortmund Spectrum Estimation Algorithm
(DSEA). The other major algorithms will soon be added.
